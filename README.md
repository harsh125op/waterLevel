`2_Image_Algo_Test.ipynb` evaluates different image processing algorithms to identify the most effective techniques.

### **Feature Extraction**

The notebook `3_POC_Feature_Extraction.ipynb` implements feature extraction methods to analyze the key aspects of images.

### **Dataset Generation**

In `4_Gen_Dataset.ipynb`, datasets are built from extracted features, which serve as input for machine learning models.

### **Data Analytics**

`5_Data_Analatics.ipynb` provides visual and statistical analysis of datasets to identify trends and insights.

### **Model Testing**

- **6\_Ensmbled\_Test.ipynb** – Evaluates ensemble models.
- **6\_LSTM\_Model\_Test.ipynb** – Tests LSTM-based architectures.
